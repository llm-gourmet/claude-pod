# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-09)

**Core value:** No secret ever leaves the isolated environment uncontrolled -- every outbound call is validated, every secret in LLM context is redacted, and Claude Code cannot bypass the security layers.
**Current focus:** Phase 08 — container-tooling-full-dev-environment-for-claude-secure

## Current Position

Phase: 09
Plan: Not started
Status: Phase complete — ready for verification
Last activity: 2026-04-10

Progress: [████████████████████] 2/2 plans (100%)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Five phases following service dependency chain (infra -> validator -> proxy -> installer -> tests)
- [Roadmap]: Phases 2 and 3 both depend on Phase 1 but are independent of each other
- [Phase 01]: Node.js 22 LTS used instead of 20 (EOL April 2026)
- [Phase 01]: Non-root claude user added (Claude Code refuses root execution)
- [Phase 01]: Settings.json at /etc/claude-secure/ with symlink to avoid volume shadowing
- [Phase 01]: Node.js used for proxy connectivity test (no curl in node:22-slim)
- [Phase 01]: Whitelist read-only verified via Docker mount RW flag (bind-mount shows host UID)
- [Phase 02-call-validation]: Shared network namespace via network_mode: service:claude for iptables enforcement
- [Phase 02-call-validation]: iptables comment module with fallback for call-ID rule tracking
- [Phase 02-call-validation]: Exit 0 with JSON permissionDecision deny for blocking (not exit 2) per verified Claude Code protocol
- [Phase 02-call-validation]: Removed dns: 127.0.0.1 from docker-compose.yml -- internal network blocks external DNS forwarding, setting broke validator resolution
- [Phase 02-call-validation]: Validator gracefully degrades when DNS fails: stores call-ID without iptables rule (defense-in-depth)
- [Phase 03-secret-redaction]: readFileSync per request for whitelist hot-reload, longest-first replacement ordering, accept-encoding stripped to prevent compressed responses
- [Phase 03-secret-redaction]: Protocol-aware transport in proxy (http vs https) for testability; mock upstream pattern via node one-liner inside container
- [Phase 04]: Source guard in install.sh for testability; whitelist symlink for user customization; set -a auto-export in CLI wrapper
- [Phase 04]: 12 tests covering 9 requirement IDs with subshell isolation and temp dir cleanup
- [Phase 07]: env_file fallback to /dev/null when SECRETS_FILE unset for graceful degradation
- [Phase 07]: Simpler ENV-04 test: verify proxy has secret + whitelist readable (full redaction tested by test-phase3.sh)
- [Phase 08]: All 10 dev packages in single apt-get layer alongside existing 4 packages
- [Phase 09]: DNS validation tested via regex extraction rather than sourcing full CLI
- [Phase quick-260411-mre]: Replicated pre-push hook test execution pattern directly in run-tests.sh for manual use

### Roadmap Evolution

- Phase 7 added: Env-file strategy and secret loading for claude-secure
- Phase 8 added: Container tooling — full dev environment for claude-secure

### Pending Todos

- **iptables packet-level logging**: Add iptables `-j LOG` rules for DROP/ACCEPT and poll `dmesg`/`/proc/kmsg` from validator background thread to capture actual packet allow/block events into `iptables.jsonl`. Currently only HTTP-level events (registration, validation) are logged — silent drops at the network layer are invisible.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: Claude Code hook response schema may have changed since training data cutoff -- verify against current docs before Phase 2
- [Research]: iptables backend on WSL2 varies by distro/kernel -- validate in installer preflight (Phase 4)
- ~~[Research]: Bidirectional placeholder restoration must be scoped to auth contexts only to prevent covert channel~~ — Addressed in Phase 3: proxy does full bidirectional replacement with longest-first ordering
