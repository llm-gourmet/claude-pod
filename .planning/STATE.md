# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-08)

**Core value:** No secret ever leaves the isolated environment uncontrolled -- every outbound call is validated, every secret in LLM context is redacted, and Claude Code cannot bypass the security layers.
**Current focus:** Phase 02 — call-validation

## Current Position

Phase: 2
Plan: Not started
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-04-08

Progress: [████████████████████] 2/2 plans (100%)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 0
- Average duration: -
- Total execution time: 0 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Five phases following service dependency chain (infra -> validator -> proxy -> installer -> tests)
- [Roadmap]: Phases 2 and 3 both depend on Phase 1 but are independent of each other
- [Phase 01]: Node.js 22 LTS used instead of 20 (EOL April 2026)
- [Phase 01]: Non-root claude user added (Claude Code refuses root execution)
- [Phase 01]: Settings.json at /etc/claude-secure/ with symlink to avoid volume shadowing
- [Phase 01]: Node.js used for proxy connectivity test (no curl in node:22-slim)
- [Phase 01]: Whitelist read-only verified via Docker mount RW flag (bind-mount shows host UID)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: Claude Code hook response schema may have changed since training data cutoff -- verify against current docs before Phase 2
- [Research]: iptables backend on WSL2 varies by distro/kernel -- validate in installer preflight (Phase 4)
- [Research]: Bidirectional placeholder restoration must be scoped to auth contexts only to prevent covert channel (Phase 3)
