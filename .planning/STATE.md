# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-09)

**Core value:** No secret ever leaves the isolated environment uncontrolled -- every outbound call is validated, every secret in LLM context is redacted, and Claude Code cannot bypass the security layers.
**Current focus:** Phase 04 — installation-platform

## Current Position

Phase: 5
Plan: Not started
Status: Phase complete — ready for verification
Last activity: 2026-04-08

Progress: [████████████████████] 2/2 plans (100%)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Five phases following service dependency chain (infra -> validator -> proxy -> installer -> tests)
- [Roadmap]: Phases 2 and 3 both depend on Phase 1 but are independent of each other
- [Phase 01]: Node.js 22 LTS used instead of 20 (EOL April 2026)
- [Phase 01]: Non-root claude user added (Claude Code refuses root execution)
- [Phase 01]: Settings.json at /etc/claude-secure/ with symlink to avoid volume shadowing
- [Phase 01]: Node.js used for proxy connectivity test (no curl in node:22-slim)
- [Phase 01]: Whitelist read-only verified via Docker mount RW flag (bind-mount shows host UID)
- [Phase 02-call-validation]: Shared network namespace via network_mode: service:claude for iptables enforcement
- [Phase 02-call-validation]: iptables comment module with fallback for call-ID rule tracking
- [Phase 02-call-validation]: Exit 0 with JSON permissionDecision deny for blocking (not exit 2) per verified Claude Code protocol
- [Phase 02-call-validation]: Removed dns: 127.0.0.1 from docker-compose.yml -- internal network blocks external DNS forwarding, setting broke validator resolution
- [Phase 02-call-validation]: Validator gracefully degrades when DNS fails: stores call-ID without iptables rule (defense-in-depth)
- [Phase 03-secret-redaction]: readFileSync per request for whitelist hot-reload, longest-first replacement ordering, accept-encoding stripped to prevent compressed responses
- [Phase 03-secret-redaction]: Protocol-aware transport in proxy (http vs https) for testability; mock upstream pattern via node one-liner inside container
- [Phase 04]: Source guard in install.sh for testability; whitelist symlink for user customization; set -a auto-export in CLI wrapper
- [Phase 04]: 12 tests covering 9 requirement IDs with subshell isolation and temp dir cleanup
- [Phase 06-service-logging]: JSONL structured logging with env-var toggle pattern (LOG_*=1), jq -nc for shell JSON, Python logging.Handler subclass for validator

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: Claude Code hook response schema may have changed since training data cutoff -- verify against current docs before Phase 2
- [Research]: iptables backend on WSL2 varies by distro/kernel -- validate in installer preflight (Phase 4)
- ~~[Research]: Bidirectional placeholder restoration must be scoped to auth contexts only to prevent covert channel~~ — Addressed in Phase 3: proxy does full bidirectional replacement with longest-first ordering
