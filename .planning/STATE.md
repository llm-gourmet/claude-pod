# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-11)

**Core value:** No secret ever leaves the isolated environment uncontrolled -- every outbound call is validated, every secret in LLM context is redacted, and Claude Code cannot bypass the security layers.
**Current focus:** Phase 13 — headless-cli-path

## Current Position

Phase: 13 (headless-cli-path) — Ready to plan
Plan: Not started
Status: Phase 12 complete, advancing to Phase 13
Last activity: 2026-04-11 -- Phase 12 execution complete

Progress: [██░░░░░░░░] 2/2 plans (17%)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 2 (v2.0)
- Average duration: ~3.5min
- Total execution time: ~7 minutes

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| Phase 12 P01 | 5min | 2 tasks | 2 files |
| Phase 12 P02 | 2min | 2 tasks | 2 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap v2.0]: Six phases following dependency chain: Profile System -> Headless CLI + Webhook Listener (parallel) -> Event Handlers -> Result Channel -> Hardening
- [Roadmap v2.0]: Phase 13 and 14 can proceed in parallel since both depend only on Phase 12
- [Research]: Claude Code `-p` flag via `docker compose exec -T` is the only correct headless integration point (SDK bypasses security layers)
- [Research]: Profile resolution must fail closed -- no fallback to default profile
- [Research]: Known bug #7263 (empty output with large stdin) needs verification at Phase 13
- [Phase 12]: Used jq to generate profile.json instead of bash config.sh for per-profile workspace config

### Pending Todos

- **iptables packet-level logging**: Add iptables `-j LOG` rules for DROP/ACCEPT and poll `dmesg`/`/proc/kmsg` from validator background thread to capture actual packet allow/block events into `iptables.jsonl`.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: systemd in WSL2 requires `[boot] systemd=true` in `/etc/wsl.conf` -- installer should detect this (affects Phase 14)
- [Research]: `--allowedTools` prefix match syntax needs empirical verification (affects Phase 13)
- [Research]: Docker Compose `deploy.resources.limits` vs `mem_limit` -- verify with `docker inspect` (affects Phase 13)
